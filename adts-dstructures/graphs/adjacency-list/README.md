# Graph Abstract Data Type - Adjacency List Implementation
  * A more space-efficient way to implement a sparsely connected graph is to use an adjacency list. In an adjacency list implementation we keep a master list of all the vertices in the Graph object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to. In our implementation of the Vertex class we will use a dictionary rather than a list where the dictionary keys are the vertices, and the values are the weights. The figure below illustrates the adjacency list representation for the graph in the [parent README](../README.md).

  * The advantage of the adjacency list implementation is that it allows us to compactly represent a sparse graph. The adjacency list also allows us to easily find all the links that are directly connected to a particular vertex.

  * Using dictionaries, it is easy to implement the adjacency list in Python. In our implementation of the Graph abstract data type we will create two classes,([Vertex and Graph](main.py)): Graph, which holds the master list of vertices, and Vertex, which will represent each vertex in the graph.
    * Each Vertex uses a dictionary to keep track of the vertices to which it is connected, and the weight of each edge. This dictionary is called connectedTo. [Vertex](main.py) shows the code for the Vertex class. The constructor simply initializes the id, which will typically be a string, and the connectedTo dictionary. The addNeighbor method is used add a connection from this vertex to another. The getConnections method returns all of the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the connectedTo instance variable. The getWeight method returns the weight of the edge from this vertex to the vertex passed as a parameter.
    * The Graph class, [Graph](main.py), contains a dictionary that maps vertex names to vertex objects. In [sample adjacency list](img/sample_adjacency_list.png), this dictionary object is represented by the shaded gray box. Graph also provides methods for adding vertices to a graph and connecting one vertex to another. The getVertices method returns the names of all of the vertices in the graph. In addition, we have implemented the __iter__ method to make it easy to iterate over all the vertex objects in a particular graph. Together, the two methods allow you to iterate over the vertices in a graph by name, or by the objects themselves.

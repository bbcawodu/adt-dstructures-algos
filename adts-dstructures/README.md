# Abstract Data Types, and Data Structures

## Linear Data Structures (Sequential Collections)
	- Linear structures are collections of elements whose elements are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added,
	it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it.
	- Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends(left and right or front and rear, etc). What distinguishes one linear structure from
	another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur. For example, a
	structure might allow new items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to be removed from either end.

	- Types of Linear Structure Abstract Data Types:
		- Stack
		- Queue

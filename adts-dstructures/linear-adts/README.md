# Linear ADTs and Data Structures (Sequential Collections)
  * Linear ADTs and data structures are collections of elements whose elements are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added,
  it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it.
  * Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends(left and right or front and rear, etc). What distinguishes one linear structure from
  another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur. For example, a
  structure might allow new items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to be removed from either end.
  * Linear ADTs and Data Structures can also be called Sequential Collections because when you start at a correct end for a given Linear ADT and iterate through the elements of the collection using the given ADT methods, the elements form a sequence.

  * Types of Linear ADTs and Data Structures:
    * Stack
    * Queue
    * Deque
    * List

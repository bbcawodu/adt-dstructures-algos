# Unordered Linked List ADT
	- A linked list is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others. More specifically, we will refer to this type of list as an unordered(with respect to the values of the items, not the positions. eg. 12 is ordered before 54) list. We can consider the list as having a first item, a second item, a third item, and so on. We can also refer to the beginning of the list (the first item) or the end of the list (the last item). For simplicity we will assume that linked lists cannot contain duplicate items.
	- Note, there is no requirement that we maintain that positioning in contiguous memory. However, if we can maintain some explicit information in each item, namely the location of the next item(some sort of pointer), then the relative position of each item can be expressed by simply following the link from one item to the next.
	- It is important to note that the location of the first item of the list must be explicitly specified. Once we know where the first item is, the first item can tell us where the second is, and so on. The external reference is often referred to as the head of the list. Similarly, the last item needs to know that there is no next item.

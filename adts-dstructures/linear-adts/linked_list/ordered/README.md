# Ordered Linked List ADT
	- There exists a type of linked list known as an ordered linked list. For example, if [93, 31, 54, 17, 26, 77] were an ordered linked list (ascending order), then it could be written as 17, 26, 31, 54, 77, and 93. Since 17 is the smallest item, it occupies the first position in the list. Likewise, since 93 is the largest, it occupies the last position.
	- The structure of an ordered linked list is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position that is based upon some underlying characteristic of the item. The ordering is typically either ascending or descending and we assume that list items have a meaningful comparison operation that is already defined. Many of the ordered linked list operations are the same as those of the unordered linked list.

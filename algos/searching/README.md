# Searching - Searching Algorithms, Functions, and Procedural Abstractions
  * Searching is the algorithmic process of finding a particular item in a collection of items.
    * A search typically answers either True or False as to whether the item is present.
    * On occasion it may be modified to return where the item is found. For our purposes here,
    we will simply concern ourselves with the question of membership.
    * In Python, there is a very easy way to ask whether an item is in a list of items. We use the in operator.
        * In javascript, the method is Array.prototype.includes.
        * In C#, the method is List.Contains or Array.Exists.
    * Although the method call is easy to write, the underlying algorithm is more complex. We will examine sequential and
    binary searching.
